## My process
  Finished completing all the markups first then styled them as close to the original designs i could using a seperate stylesheet.
  
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got to play with different box shadow values and decided to keep the one that felt close to home!

```html
<a href="#">
          <div class="btn btn-primary">
            Proceed to Payment
          </div>
        </a>
```
```css
.btn-primary{
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    font-weight: 500;
    padding: 0.7rem 0rem;
    background-color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
    color: white;
    border-radius: 10px;
    min-width: 100%;
    box-shadow: 0px 20px 25px rgb(56 41 224/ 20%); 
    transition: 0.2s ease-in;
}
}
```

### Continued development

I am still a bit hectic when it comes to making a website responsive and my skills fare okay for now but i am learning a css framework to better create a repsonsive website.
